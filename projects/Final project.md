For this project, I aim to design and develop a simple yet visually appealing online tea store using HTML and CSS. The website will serve as a platform to showcase different varieties of tea, highlighting their unique flavors and health benefits. It will feature an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows visitors to explore product details effortlessly. The focus will be on creating a well-structured static website with a clean layout, engaging visuals, and smooth navigation. To ensure accessibility across all devices, I will implement responsive design principles, making the website adaptable for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens. By combining structured HTML content with elegant CSS styling, the goal is to deliver a seamless browsing experience that enhances user engagement and interest in the tea offerings.
