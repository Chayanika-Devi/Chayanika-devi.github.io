Facial Landmarks
The facial landmarks estimator network aims to predict the (x,y) location of landmarks (keypoints) for a given input face image. FPENet (Fiducial Points Estimator Network) is generally used in conjunction with a face detector and the output is commonly used for face alignment, head pose estimation, emotion detection, eye blink detection, gaze estimation, among others. Besides the facial landmarks, key points estimator can also be used to predict the keypoints for general-purpose applications.

I am working on a my own picture for landmark detection Working on a personal project focused on landmark detection can be a fascinating endeavor. By developing a system that recognizes and identifies landmarks within images, I have been trying to utilize computer vision and machine learning. This project likely involves training models to recognize distinct architectural facial landmarks from various angles and conditions.
