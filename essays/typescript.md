TypeScript offers a significant upgrade by introducing a robust type system. This system enhances code reliability and maintainability,especially useful in larger projects, while maintaining JavaScript's familiar syntax. Essentially,TypeScript equips JavaScript with additional safety measures, making it an excellent choice forprofessional software development.

If you are familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript is relatively easy to pick up as it builds on top of existing syntax, adding type annotations which can help catch errors early on.Coming from a non-programming background, it might take a while to grasp the main parts ofcode, such as the body of a function where the core logic resides.

Even if you have prior coding experience, TypeScript introduces new concepts like interfaces,generics, and advanced type annotations, expanding your understanding of how to structure and manage complex data types.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
