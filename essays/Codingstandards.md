Throughout my undergraduate studies in India, I faced significant difficulties in understanding coding. I clearly remember the initial programming class I took; it seemed a foreign language that I was forced to learn overnight. While the professor was describing conditionals and loops, all I could see on the screen were perplexing symbols and arbitrary terms like while, if, and otherwise. Reading nonfiction is fun for me. Not just computing, but also biology, physics, philosophy, robotics, mechanical engineering, and other technical subjects.
Writing this code is significantly more challenging, as it involves not only instructing a computer but also contending with another user's cognitive framework regarding your code. Computer science and reasoning psychology are now equally important, or something. How can you facilitate that individual’s understanding of your code?In fact, I think that learning a programming language can be aided by certain coding standards.
Feynman famously said: Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings. about something very different, but in a funny way I think this describes programming for humans a bit. The person interpreting your code actually has feelings!Humans are exceptional at recognizing patterns, whereas computers adhere to Boolean logic and execute precise commands. Developer tool documentation is frequently organized like a computer program. It begins by defining a fundamental data model together with its relationships and components. 
A human conversation on the other hand, or a novel, or a political speech, pulls on unseen associations via language, and they connote complex world views and intentions which cannot be ascribed to any particular moment or a smaller chunk of words. We are, in the parlance of data science, neural-net driven pattern recognition machines. However, the way it feels to listen to a politician on screen doesn’t feel anything like back-propagating a loss function through hidden layers to adjust the weights and biases of a neural net.

It feels gooey, and human. Just like writing.

After the first week of using ESLint with VS Code, I think I  feel that it is both helpful as well as painful. Although it efficiently detects possible code problems and keeps consistency, fixing all errors can initially feel overwhelming, particularly if I am  unfamiliar with the selected coding standards. This means that there will be a learning curve to adjust and fine-tune the configuration to my needs.In short, the only thing that matters is Consistency. And as huge standards documents are too much to read and memorise, so I prefer to go step by step instructions so that is easier for me to code.

## Conclusion

I think regular practice will solidify your comprehension of programming principles and progressively enhance your skills. With time, you will enhance your proficiency and confidence in your coding abilities.
