## What I think about effort estimation and tracking

In software engineering, effort estimation and tracking are two of the most crucial components of project management. Estimation aids in determining the time and resources required for a task or an entire project. By tracking, we can keep an eye on the real progress and contrast it with the original plan.When I started our final project, the Manoa Bird Watch, it was crucial for me to divide it into smaller tasks and determine the amount of effort required for each task (typically in hours or days).Although estimation is not always completely accurate, it provides the team and me with a general understanding of what to anticipate.

## My Contribution to our final project 
For our final assignment, I was assigned with developing the home landing page utilizing HTML and CSS. In order to comprehend typical design patterns and find potential elements that could improve user experience, I researched current bird watching programs before beginning the design. This preliminary research assisted me in designing the layout and structure of our interface.
Designing the initial design of the landing page took approximately six hours. During this period, I focused on organizing the layout, adding a suitable logo, and making sure the final design complemented our project's concept. Upon completion of the original draft, I disseminated it to the team for input.
While the functionality was established, the visual quality of the initial version required enhancement. I modified the page to improve its visual quality based on the feedback received. Having acquired proficiency in HTML and CSS technologies during the training, the redesign process required me less than six hours.To facilitate the process, I followed to our team's project spreadsheet. Estimations were documented in a project spreadsheet, which was consistently updated with actual hours expended. This made it easier for me to compare my initial projections with actual development and make any necessary corrections.

## Benefits of acutal time tracking
Using estimates helps avoid overcommitting or undercommitting resources. You don't want your team to be stuck in a sea of unfinished work or to be sitting around doing nothing because you assumed it would take six months to develop a basic feature. Accurate estimations will result in a highly efficient development team.Estimations foster a collective comprehension of the project's dimensions among team members and clients. When all members are aligned about tasks and deadlines, collaboration becomes more efficient, allowing the team to concentrate on their core competencyâ€”producing exceptional code.Numerous estimating challenges are caused by lack of interaction among developers, managers, and various stakeholders. Maintain open and transparent communication to prevent significant distress. It is preferable to over-communicate rather than to anticipate that others will initiate communication. Require an item from an individual by a specified deadline? Encourage them with friendly reminders. Concerned that someone might misinterpret your requirements? Highlight and emphasize each criterion multiple times.

## My takeaway from project estimation
This assignment taught me the significance of effort estimation in the planning and timely execution of activities. I was able to remain focused and organized by estimating the time needed for each task. It provided a clear understanding of the required workload and facilitated improved schedule management. Although the estimates were not consistently accurate, they facilitated progress monitoring and enabled necessary revisions. All things considered, this experience taught me how to operate more effectively in a team environment and make more realistic plans.
