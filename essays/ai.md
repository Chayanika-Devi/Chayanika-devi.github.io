## Introduction
With the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI (GenAI), and Conversational Agents (CAs), a wider discussion has started among computer scientists and educators, some urging for the necessity of “a major upheaval” in the field (Welsh, 2022), arguing the idea of writing computer programs and consequently, educating people for this purpose, "is headed for extinction".Numerous applications of AI in education (AIED) have emerged. For example, Khan Academy offers Khanmigo, an AI tutor harnessing GPT-4 capabilities, delivering personalized learning support and intelligent feedback across various subjects, including mathematics, programming, and language learning.In the Software Engineering course, I made use of AI tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to support code generation, debugging, and understanding software development concepts.GitHub Copilot assisted me in writing and completing code more efficiently by suggesting context-aware code snippets, while ChatGPT helped clarify programming concepts, debug errors, and generate explanations for complex problems.



## Personal Experience with AI

## Experience WODs e.g. E18
I used b Copilot primarily while working on WODs such as E18. Copilot was especially helpful in speeding up the coding process by providing relevant code suggestions and reducing the time spent on syntax and boilerplate code. 
## In-class Practice WODs
I used ChatGPT during in-class practice WODs to better understand programming concepts and debug issues. ChatGPT was particularly useful for explaining errors, clarifying instructions, and suggesting alternative approaches when I encountered challenges. It served as a helpful resource for quick, on-the-spot learning, allowing me to complete tasks more efficiently and confidently during timed sessions.

## In-class WODs
During in-class WODs, I used both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to enhance my performance and learning.However, even with the help of these tools, I still found some problems difficult to solve, which showed me how important it is to have a good understanding of the basics.

## Essays
For essay writing, I used ChatGPT and Google resources to help me develop ideas, organize content, and improve the quality of my writing. ChatGPT was helpful for generating outlines, rephrasing sentences, and checking grammar. It also gave me suggestions on how to make my arguments clearer and more structured. I used Google to find reliable sources, gather facts, and understand the background of the topics I was writing about. Together, these tools supported me in creating well-informed and well-organized essays.

## Final Project
For my final project, I chose not to use ChatGPT because I focused on learning how to create an HTML and CSS page from scratch, a skill I learned from this course. This approach allowed me to apply the knowledge I had gained in coding and web design, reinforcing the concepts taught during the course.

## Learning a concept / tutorial
When learning new concepts or following tutorials, I did not use ChatGPT. Instead, I relied on the instructional videos provided by the course. These videos helped me understand key concepts and gave step-by-step guidance for applying what I learned. 

## Answering a question in class or in Discord
When answering questions in class or on Discord, I did not use AI tools like ChatGPT. Instead, I relied on my own understanding and knowledge to respond. These answers were based on what I had learned from the course materials, discussions, and my personal experience with coding and problem-solving.
## Asking or answering a smart-question
When asking or answering smart questions, I did not use AI tools like ChatGPT. Instead, I focused on formulating my questions or responses based on the knowledge I had gained through the course and research.
## Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
For coding examples, such as "giving an example of using Underscore.js .pluck," I usedcCopilot. Copilot helped me quickly generate relevant code snippets and provided context-aware suggestions. For example, when I asked for an example of .pluck, copilot auto-completed the code and offered a simple demonstration of how the function works with arrays of objects.
## Explaining code
When explaining code, I used AI tools like ChatGPT to clarify complex parts and ensure I understood the logic behind the implementation, as it helped break down concepts into simpler terms.

## Writing code
When writing code, I used Ccopilot and chatgpt to speed up the process by generating code suggestions and completing repetitive patterns, allowing me to focus on the logic and functionality.

## Documenting code
When documenting code, I used AI tools like ChatGPT to help generate clear and concise explanations for functions and methods, making the documentation process faster and more efficient. For example: while using react app it helped me so much understanding the steps.

## Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
For quality assurance tasks, such as asking "What’s wrong with this code?" or "Fix the ESLint errors in this code," I used copilot and ChatGPT. These tools helped me quickly identify issues in the code and suggested fixes.


## Impact on Learning and Understanding
Using AI tools like copilot and ChatGPT has greatly helped my learning in the Software Engineering course. Copilot made coding easier by suggesting code and automating repetitive parts, saving me time and letting me focus on solving harder problems. It helped me see how code fit into my project and improved my understanding of programming.

ChatGPT was also very useful for explaining difficult concepts in simple terms. Whether I was stuck on a concept or needed help fixing errors, ChatGPT gave me clear answers that made the material easier to understand. Being able to ask questions and get answers quickly boosted my confidence and kept me engaged with the course.

In summary, while AI tools have been a great aid in my learning journey, they have also posed challenges in terms of over-reliance and occasionally oversimplified explanations.

## Practical Applications

The effectiveness of AI applications in real-world software engineering challenges has been widely recognized. AI can greatly improve productivity by automating repetitive tasks, detecting errors early in the development cycle, and providing developers with valuable insights that may not be immediately obvious. In large-scale software projects, this can significantly speed up the development process and improve the overall quality of the software.One example of AI in real-world software engineering applications is in the Healthcare AI Collaborative (HACC), where AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are used to assist in analyzing medical data, diagnosing diseases, and improving patient outcomes. In these kinds of projects, AI models can help automate repetitive tasks, such as reading medical images or processing patient records, which saves valuable time and reduces human error.However, while AI tools are incredibly useful, they also come with challenges. One limitation is that AI applications still require human oversight to ensure accuracy and to handle cases that the AI may not fully understand. Additionally, AI's reliance on large amounts of data means it can sometimes be biased or produce inaccurate results if the data it learns from isn't diverse or high-quality.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Conversational AI has the potential to disrupt various phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). While much of the current research focuses on code generation and repair, conversational AI is also being integrated into team training, expert recommendations, documentation, and maintenance tasks. The proficiency of applying conversational AI varies across different SDLC areas, but the general trend is toward integrating AI while maintaining human oversight to mitigate limitations. The key challenge lies in increasing developers' awareness of both the potential and limitations of conversational AI tools, as the technology is still evolving, and its usage is not fully understood.

## Comparative Analysis
Compared to traditional learning methods, using AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot made coding and problem-solving faster and more interactive. While textbooks and lectures help build strong fundamentals, AI tools provide instant support and real-time feedback. Combining both approaches gave me a more balanced and effective learning experience.

## Future Considerations
While we identify several promising areas for integrating conversational AI in software engineering education, such as requirements elicitation, software modeling, software management, and software quality, more empirical studies are needed to assess the impact of these interventions on student learning.In the future, I plan to use AI tools more thoughtfully—balancing their convenience with a deeper focus on understanding the core concepts. I also want to explore more advanced AI features for testing, debugging, and project planning, while continuing to strengthen my own problem-solving and coding skills.


## Conclusion

With COVID-19, the education sector has already seen significant disruption and permanent changes to learning, teaching, and assessment, and the technological shift will continue with generative AI platforms. However, it is still too early to assess the impact of conversational AI technologies when public opinion on inaccurate content and sources and lack of originality shapes.Specifically within Software Engineering, the increasing capabilities of AI, particularly LLMs, are beginning to transform tools and practices across the software development lifecycle. From engaging with stakeholders to generating code and tests to providing maintenance recommendations, AI assistants are demonstrating the potential to significantly boost the productivity of software engineers. However, fully realizing this potential requires further advances in the reliability, interpretability, and adaptability of AI models.
