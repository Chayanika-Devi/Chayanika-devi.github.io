When I first started using bootstrap, I thought it was the best way to build a website. If you need a menu bar, a pop-up window, or buttons, "boom!" And the most amazing thing is that it looks stunning. It looks like everything is easy, and you are very smart.Bootstrap is an awesome library that help you quickly build up beautiful UI interface and many people all over the world use it. But donâ€™t let this magic restrict your power, with great CSS skill, you can create something more outstanding.

## why bother to use something like Bootstrap 5?

For me, it is time f to build up UI interface, I browsed many kinds of websites and felt astonished every time I saw amazing stuff, and here came a big question, I do not know how to build them. So I tried and I started to realize CSS is not as easy as I think. I think after you have good understanding about position, display, @ media, @ keyframes, etc. You can draw most of pictures on your browser now, and this time you feel CSS is no longer pain in the neck.

While Bootstrap is easy to use, it is not so easy to customize as you might think. Some components will require you to use  several times, which is not ideal when creating CSS. And having to override the default styles of Bootstrap is just like having to create your own CSS from start.

## Advantages
I think it speeds up my development process! Because I am using some ready-to-use code and I do not need to write them from the scratch.
I do not have to reinvent the wheel! I need something that has been previously created and optimized by other developers. It is not a good idea to waste my time.

## Disadvantages
It is hard to customize the styles. I had this problem with material UI. They give you a lot of options for style customization but it is still a pain in the neck. With pure CSS, you can do whatever you want! I had a challenges with text alignment ,navigation bar and footer!

## Why not just use raw HTML and CSS?
It is not hard to learn HTML and CSS; all you need to know are the basics of syntax and style rules. Then you can figure out how the code works and how to change it. You have access to great documents and can find answers to all sorts of problems on the internet, so you do not need to remember a lot of rules and keywords. You just need to remember the general rules. HTML and CSS are always going to come up in web design, and I think it is very helpful and even necessary to know a little about them.

I think HTML & CSS provide complete control over design, allowing for limitless customization. Bootstrap, on the other hand, follows predefined styles and components, which can be customized but within certain boundaries.


## Conclusion

Yes, UI frameworks have a lot of benefits for software engineers. They can speed up development, make sure that all applications have the same look and feel, allow responsive design, work across browsers, give developers access to a large community of other developers, and cut down on code duplication by providing pre-built components, all of which improve the overall quality and efficiency of development.
