## What are design patterns?

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?
There are multiple reasons to learn design patterns:

Code that is simpler to comprehend, update, and expand is produced with the help of design patterns.
They offer solutions that have been tried and tested as well as best practices.
Learning this enables them to quickly and effectively address similar challenges in various projects.
Developers can produce reusable components that can be utilized in a variety of applications by implementing design patterns.
This reduces redundancy and saves development time.

## What design patterns have you used in your own code?
In the Manoa Bird Watch project, I utilized creational design patterns to facilitate flexible and efficient object creation management. I employed the Factory Pattern to dynamically produce various sorts of bird sightings contingent upon user input for example different bird species. This enabled the system to maintain modularity and scalability with the introduction of new avian types or data structures. By encapsulating the instantiation logic, I achieved improved code organization, diminished redundancy, and increased maintainability of the application architecture.

## Conclusion
Working on the Manoa Bird Watch project gave me practical experience with creational design patterns. Implementing this pattern helped me understand how to simplify object creation and make the system more adaptable to change. It also improved my ability to write clean, reusable, and scalable codeâ€”skills that are essential in real-world software development.
